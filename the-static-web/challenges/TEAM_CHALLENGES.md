# Team Challenges

## Challenge \#1

1. Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled *Create*.
1. When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM - similar to the quiz and group project. You decide the height/width of the card.
1. Above the text on each card, there must be two input controls of type `color`.
1. Above the text on each card, there must be a button element labeled *Delete*.
1. When the user selects a color from the first input, then the background color of that card, and no other cards, should change to the color chosen.
1. When the user selects a color from the second input, then the font color of that card, and no other cards, should change to the color chosen.
1. When the user clicks the *Delete* button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.

##Challenge \#2

1. In HTML, create 3 divs
1. Give each div a background color
1. When one of the three divs is clicked do the following:
1. Give the selected/clicked div a border to indicate it has been selected
1. Reveal a form with an input box and a button
1. The user should now be able to enter a color value in the input field.
1. When the corresponding button is clicked, the currently selected div should change its background color to the color value the user entered in the input box.

Finish in under 3 hours? Figure out how to do the same with jQuery.

##Challenge \#3

1. Add a red, 100px x 100px div and a button to a basic HTML page
1. When the button is clicked, make the div double in size, and change the color from red to blue.
1. After 3 seconds, make the div revert to its original size and color.

##Challenge \#4 TIC TAC TOE
1. Create a grid of nine boxes
1. When any box is clicked a red `X` appears

1. #1 and #2 are repeated until a row of 3 of the same character is created
1. When a win happens:
    1. Alert the players who won
    1. Disallow any further clicks on the game board
    1. Display a `play again` button that resets the game
