# Banking form

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below, open a terminal window on your **host machine** (i.e. do not be logged into the Vagrant machine), and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/the-static-web/banking-form && cd $_
touch index.html
```
