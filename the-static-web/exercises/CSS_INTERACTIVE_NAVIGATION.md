# Interactive navigation bar

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below, open a terminal window on your **host machine** (i.e. do not be logged into the Vagrant machine), and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/the-static-web/interactive-navigation && cd $_
touch index.html
touch navigation.css
```

## Instructions

Create a navigation bar out of an unordered list element, and add the following interactivity.

1. When the user hovers over one of the links, the color of the text should change.
1. When the user hovers over one of the links, the background color of the element that contains the link should change.
1. When the user clicks on one of the links, the element that contains the link should grow in size by 5px on the left and right.
