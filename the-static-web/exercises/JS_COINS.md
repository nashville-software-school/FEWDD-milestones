# Counting Coins

## Setup

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/the-static-web/coins && cd $_
touch index.html
touch coins.js

```js
/*
  Input: 0.67
  Output:
  {
    quarters: 2,
    dimes: 1,
    nickels: 1,
    pennies: 2
  }

*/

function coinCounter () {
  // Initialize a JavaScript object to hold the coins
  var coinPurse = {};
  
  coinPurse.quarters = 0;

  return coinPurse;
}

var coins = coinCounter()
console.log();
```
