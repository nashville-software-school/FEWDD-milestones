# Javascript 101 - Part 1

> There is a popular paradox stated about JavaScript. "Because JavaScript can be used without understanding, the understanding of the language is often never attained."

You will not be one of those people. You will understand the power, complexities, and versatility of JavaScript when you leave this cohort.

## Overview

Javascript is **the most important language** you will use as a front end developer, and possibly for much of your career, because it is the language of the web browser. All browser based applications - Facebook, Twitter, Etsy, Pinterest - are all written with JavaScript.

## The Alert

Use alert to show messages to people using your application.

`alert("Thank you for using our product");`

## Variables

Learn how to store values in human readable variables that can be used throughout your code, and changed when necessary. It is the same as your bank account number. That number never changes, but the actual value of your bank account changes daily as you make money and spend money.

### Number values

You bank account number is a variable, and the money contained in it is the value of the variable. In JavaScript, you can create a variable name that will hold any value you want.

`var bankAccount = 1000;`

Now, anywhere else in the code that you use the `bankAccount` variable, the value of 1000 will actually be used.

`var combinedAccount = 2000 + bankAccount;`

The new variable called `combinedAccount` will now hold the value 3000.

### String values
Variables can hold all kinds of values. Here's one holding a string value. Strings are a continuous collection of letters and values inside two quote characters.

```
var instructor = "Steve";
var numberOfStudents = "15";
```

### Boolean values

These variables will hold the value of `true` or `false`.

```
var studentsAreAwesome = true;
var limaBeansAreYummy = false;
```

### Declaring variables

You can declare a variable first, and then assign it a value later.
```
var fruit;
fruit = "apple";
```

But, as we saw before, you can declare it and assign it a value on the same line of code.
```
var fruit = "apple";
```

### Changing variable values

Declare a variable and give it an initial value.

```
var name = "Beth";
```

You can modify the value of a variable at any time, which is why they are called variables, because their value varies any time you want.

```
var name = "Susan";
```

If you tried to use the variable `name` at this point, it's value would be `Susan` even though you initially provided the value of `Beth`.

## Math Expressions

How to do math with JavaScript. Show the main mathematical operators, and their use with integer value variables.

`+`,`-`,`/`,`%`, `*`

## Conditions with *if* and *else*

Learn how to check if something is true or false, and execute different code for each case. First, you evaluate if a condition is true or false.  If it is true, execute the code inside the surrounding curly braces (or mustaches).

> **Tip: ** There are several types of punctuation in JavaScript. {} are braces, [] are brackets, () are parenthesis, <> are angle brackets.

```
if (studentsAreAwesome) {
   alert("Congratulations!! You get a new career.");
}
```

If `studentsAreAwesome` was **false**, then the alert would not be shown. Use the else condition to handle when your evaluation is false.

```
if (studentsAreAwesome) {
   alert("Congratulations!! You get a new career.");
} else {
   alert("Back to the plutonium mines for you!");
}
```

## The console

Learn how to output the value of variables to the browser's console.

```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

## Arrays

Arrays are like buckets that you can use to store a collection numbers and/or strings.

```
var commands = ["blue", 42, "shift left", "hut"];
```

### Adding/removing items to an array

You can specify a value to place at a specific index (position).

```
commands[0] = "periwinkle";
commands[3] = 24;

// ["periwinkle", 42, "shift left", 24]
```

You can use the `push()` method which is available on an variable that holds an array. This method puts a new item on the end of the array.

```
commands.push("hot route");

// ["periwinkle", 42, "shift left", 24, "hot route"]
```

To remove the last item, you have to `pop()` it off.

```
var lastOne = commands.pop();

// ["periwinkle", 42, "shift left", 24]
// lastOne now contains the value "hot route"
```

The `unshift()` and `shift()` methods add and remove items from the beginning of the array.


## Loops with *for*

Learn how to execute the same code against every items in an array. The *for* loop has several key elements that allow you to execute the same logic over and over again, a predetermined number of times.

First, you state an initial value that will be checked each time through the loop.

```
for (var count = 1;;) {
   // Do something
}
```
Next, you put in a condition check. If it evaluates to true, then the logic inside the loop will execute.
```
for (var count = 1; count < 10;) {
   // Do something
}
```
The last element is what will be executed each time through your loop. In this example, we're simply going to increase the value of our `count` variable by 1.
```
for (var count = 1; count < 10; count = count + 1) {
   console.log("Current value of count = ", count);
}
```

You can perform any mathematical operation on the `count` variable that you want. Increment by 1, decrement by 5, multiply by 3, divide by 10... whatever you need for the problem you're trying to solve.

## String manipulation

### Joining two strings together
It's called concatenation.
```
var firstName = "Michael";
var lastName = "Corleone";
var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

alert(fullName);
```

In JavaScript, the `+` character not only adds two numbers together, but it also concatenates strings

### How long is it?
```
var phrase = "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood";
alert(phrase.length);
```
### Finding characters in a string
You use the `indexOf()` method that is automatically added to any variable that holds a string value.

```js
var phrase = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

// In JavaScript, the first position of a string 
// (called the index) is actually 0, not 1. The 
// same is true in arrays.
alert(phrase.indexOf("T"));

alert(phrase.indexOf("x"));
```

### Determine which character is at a position in a string
Yo use the `charAt()` method that is automatically added to any variable that holds a string value.

```js
var phrase = "How now brown cow?";
var position = phrase.charAt(8);
alert(position); // Will alert "b"
```

### Replacing characters in a string
You use the `replace()` method that is automatically added to any variable that holds a string value.

```js
var phrase = "The lazy dog";
var newPhrase = phrase.replace("lazy", "bounding");
alert(newPhrase);
```

Change every occurrence by using a regular expression. Try this out.

```js
var phrase = "The lazy dog likes the weird fox";
var newPhrase = phrase.replace(/o/g, "i");
alert(newPhrase);
```

### Converting strings to numbers

```js
var five = "5"; // "5"
var numberFive = parseInt(five); // 5
```

## Adding strings to your web page

Learn to use `document.getElementById()` and  `element.innerHTML` to add text to a web page with JavaScript. This is an alternative to `document.write()` which is taught in the Treehouse video for their first JavaScript program.

##### **Example**
---
```html
<div id="container">

</div>
```

```javascript
var phrase = "Hey, look at me!";
var element = document.getElementById("container");
element.innerHTML = phrase;
```

## Switch statement

```js
var value = 10;
switch (value) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Small number");
  case 5:
    console.log("Medium number");
  case 1:
    console.log("Large number");
  default:
    console.log("Dunno");
}
```
