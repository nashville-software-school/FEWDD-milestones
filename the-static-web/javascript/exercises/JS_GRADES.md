# Student grades

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below, open a terminal window on your **host machine** (i.e. do not be logged into the Vagrant machine), and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/the-static-web/grades && cd $_
touch index.html
touch grades.js
```

## Instructions

Loop over an array of student grades (values from 50-100) and outputs how many of each grades there are. 

* A score of 50-60 is an F
* A score of 61-70 is a D
* A score of 71-80 is a C
* A score of 81-90 is a B
* A score of 91-100 is an A

Start with array of random scores in your JavaScript

```js
var scores = [82, 71, 95, 55, 98, 69, 72, 78, 84, 64, 58, 87];
```


Use `console.log` to output the following criteria:

1. How many of each grade?
1. What is the lowest grade?
1. What is the highest grade?
