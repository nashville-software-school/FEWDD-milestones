# Counting Coins

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below, open a terminal window on your **host machine** (i.e. do not be logged into the Vagrant machine), and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/the-static-web/coins && cd $_
touch index.html
touch coins.js
```

## Instructions

Write a program that will convert a dollar amount to the number of coins that make up the amount. Use the common American coins of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

```js
/*
  Input: 0.67
  Output:
  {
    quarters: 2,
    dimes: 1,
    nickels: 1,
    pennies: 2
  }

*/

function coinCounter () {
  // Initialize a JavaScript object to hold the coins
  var coinPurse = {};
  
  coinPurse.quarters = 0;

  return coinPurse;
}

var coins = coinCounter()
console.log();
```
