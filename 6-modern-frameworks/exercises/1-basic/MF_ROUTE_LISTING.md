# Route Listing

## Prerequisite

It is recommended that you complete the [Route Routing](./MF_ROUTE_ROUTING.md) exercise before starting this one.

## Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/modern-framework/route-listing && cd $_
```

## Requirements

In this exercise you will add a default view to your Routes of America application.

1. Add an additional route to your application that will load a listing view.
1. The listing view simply shows two hyperlinks that route the user to the two routes you built previously.
1. Add an `otherwise` configuration option to your routing.

Start `http-server` and access both of the existing routes and verify that they still work. Then verify that the base route works.

This route shows the list: [http://localhost:8080/#/](http://localhost:8080/#/)
