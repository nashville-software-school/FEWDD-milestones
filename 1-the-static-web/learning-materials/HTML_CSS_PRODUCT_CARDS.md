# The Static Web HTML + CSS

## Setup

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/the-static-web/productcards && cd $_
```

This will create a project folder and cd you into it.
+ Once your repository is created on GitHub, copy the list of commands under **"..or create a new repository on the command line"** by clicking on the clipboard icon
+ Paste the commands into your terminal. This will create a README.md file, add it, commit it, connect your local repo to GitHub, and set you up to push up the changes. (If the last command, `git push origin master` isn't automatically executed, hit enter/return to run it).

All of your work should be on a branch, NOT on master. To do this, type:

```bash
git checkout -b exercise
touch index.html
mkdir css && touch css/style.css
mkdir images
```

You are now ready to work in the `exercise` branch.

When your work is complete, push up the branch (`git push origin exercise`) and submit the pull request on Github.
