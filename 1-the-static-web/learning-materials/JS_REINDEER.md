# Reindeer

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/the-static-web/reindeer && cd $_
touch index.html
touch reindeer.js
```

## Requirements

Paste the following code into the `<body>` of the HTML file.

```
<div id="reindeer"></div>
```

Paste the following code into your JavaScript file.

```
var colors = ["Blue", "Red", "Orange", "Purple", "Hazel", "Aquamarine", "Periwinkle", "Azure", "Fuchsia", "Chocolate", "Amber", "Amaranth"];
var reindeer = ["Dasher", "Dancer", "Prancer", "Vixen", "Comet", "Cupid", "Donner", "Blitzen"];


var hohohoElement = document.getElementById("reindeer");
```

Your task is to loop through all the reindeer in the array, and add the name of the reindeer to the single HTML `<div>` element provided. The name of the reindeer should be prepended with the corresponding color from the other array.

> **Example output:**  
>  
> Blue Dasher  
>  
> Red Dancer  
>  
> ...
