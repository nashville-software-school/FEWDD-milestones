# Music History Part 01

This is the project that you will be working for your individual work throughout the entire front end course. Don't worry, you'll be building lots of other applications, but when you learn a new technique, library or language, you'll be cutting your teeth with it on Music History.

Visit the [Music History Boilerplate](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/musichistory-boilerplate) repository on Github and you're going to follow the instructions listed there.
