Create a stackLetters function that should console.log rows of letters. It should take an array containing the letters of the alphabet and output them like this:

```
a
ab
abc
abcd
abcde
abcdef
etc
```

Then add logic to `stackLetters` that places a space after every fifth letter, like this:

```
a
ab
abd
abcd
abcde
abcde f
etc
```
