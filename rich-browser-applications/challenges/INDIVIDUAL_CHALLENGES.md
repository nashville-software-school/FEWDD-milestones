## Challenge \#3

## Challenge \#4

OAuth.io provides integration with [Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/), which allows you to have full user management for an application instead of relying upon another service like Google, Facebook, or Github to handle user authentication.

Sign up for a free Stormpath account, integrated with OAuth.io and then build a registration & login view for your application that lets user create a new account for use with your Music History.
