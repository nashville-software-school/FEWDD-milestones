# Solar System

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/spa/array-methods && cd $_
touch index.html
touch array-methods.js
```

### Requirements

1. Copy the code below into the JavaScript file, and follow the instructions in the comments.

```javascript
const planets = ["mercury", "venus", "earth", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus", "neptune"]

/*
    Use the forEach method to add the name of each planet
    to a section element in your HTML with an id of "planets".
    Use string templates to construct the DOM elements.
*/
const planetEl = document.getElementById("planets")

/*
    Use the map method to create a new array where the 
    first letter of each planet is capitalized. Use the
    `toUpperCase()` method on strings.

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase
*/


/*
    Use the filter method to create a new array that
    contains planets with the letter 'e'. Use the `includes()`
    method on strings.

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes
*/


// Use the reduce method to create a sentence from the words in the following array
const words = ["The", "early", "bird", "might", "get", "the", "worm", "but", "the", "second", "mouse", "gets", "the", "cheese"]
```
