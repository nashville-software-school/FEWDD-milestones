# Browserify Your Sandwich Maker

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/mjd/sandwich && cd $_
```

1. Use `npm` to install Browserify, and any other packages you need to compile your modules.

## Instructions

Convert your Sandwich Maker code to use CommonJS module pattern instead of the IIFE pattern and have a [Grunt task](../resources/BROWSERIFY_GRUNTFILE.md) for compiling your modules.
